<h3>Coverage :</h3>OOP
<h3>Question :</h3>
Create a class called Date that includes three pieces of information as instance variables—a
month (typeint), a day (typeint) and a year (typeint). Your class should have a constructor that
initializes the three instance variables and assumes that the values provided are correct.
Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. Provide a method displayDate that
displays the month, day and year separated by forward slashes(/). Write a test application
named DateTest that demonstrates classDate’s capabilities.
