Create a new class called ‘Item’ with two protected instance variables (private variables), an
integer variable called ‘location’, and a String variable called ‘description’.
Add a constructor method for the Item class that takes an integer and a String as arguments (in
that order). The constructor should assign the value of these parameters to the corresponding
instance variables. Add getter and setter methods for the location and description variables. Add
another class called Monster and make the Monster class a sub-class of the Item class. Add a
constructor method to the Monster class that takes an integer and a String argument just like the
Item class constructor.
Use these arguments to call the Item super class constructor from within the Monster class
constructor so that the instance variables in the superclass are instantiated correctly.Write a
suitable main method in a different class and call all the methods.
